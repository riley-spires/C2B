## Getting Started

Copy `qbs.h` into your repo

See `build.cpp` for a basic usage case. Then bootstrap build.cpp with your favorite
c++ compiler. For example:

```console
g++ build.cpp -o build
./build
```

The above commands will compile your project as you have defined in your `build.cpp`


## Credits

- Heavily inspired by [nob.h](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h).
I am hoping to derive more from [nob.h](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h) as time goes on
